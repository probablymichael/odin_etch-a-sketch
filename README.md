:computer: This project is part of the JavaScript Basics, which is in the Foundations.

:phone: In this project, we were asked to create a **etch-a-sketch** board, *pretty old game isnt it?*

:minidisc: The skills needed for this project were the mostly DOM-based.

# Warning

:warning: Before critiquing this project, keep in mind that it's not fully complete.

First of all, you might have checked the commits. Yes, I did not make this in a couple of minutes, this actually took me hours to make, *but I was on Windows*. So, I just got on linux afterwards and committed everything.

From what I've seen, it has grid-based issues (grid meaning the board) when trying to add my footer at the bottom and when trying 99x99 it was **extremely** laggy and the board kind of broke.

I'll soon work on improving my code and generally my understanding of set code.
Peace!
