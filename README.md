:computer: This project is part of the JavaScript Basics, which is in the Foundations.

:phone: In this project, we were asked to create a **etch-a-sketch** board, *pretty old game isnt it?*

:minidisc: The skills needed for this project were the mostly DOM-based.

# Extra Features

After finally fixing the grid duplication, I added some animations/transitions and the footer to make the site look better. There's one thing left though.

I want to improve the grid mechanics a bit. When the user is clicking, they can draw. When the user isn't clicking, they can't draw. I'll probably need to change a good amount of the code so I don't know when I'm going to revisit.
Enjoy the fix!
